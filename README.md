# prescribing-seminar-dec2016

## Notes

- This repository contains material to support a seminar providing a basic introduction to gp prescribing data (and a christmas quiz) given at NHLI in December 2016.

- The presentation given is viewable [here](http://carlreynolds.net/prescribing-seminar-dec2016/)

- A brief description of how the presentation was made is [here](https://gist.github.com/drcjar/39273c3ccc4066748dca64b17b818e9f)

- If you wish to explore the notebook then I would suggest cloning the repo, making a python virtual environment, and running pip install -r requirments.txt

- You would also need to download the prescribing data itself from [here](http://datagov.ic.nhs.uk/presentation/2016_08_August/T201608PDPI+BNFT.CSV). I have not included it in the repo because it is too large.
