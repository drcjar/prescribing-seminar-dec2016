# Today you will learn (if you didn't know it already)

##
1. The difference between Colphon, colophōn, and colophony  
2. The difference between python and python 
3. That GP Prescribing Datasets are available and fun to play with (with a special look at puffers and pecuniary matters)

> In 2014/15, 464,000 working days were lost due to work-related breathing or lung problems (95% confidence interval: 188,000 – 739,000)

> There are currently approximately 12,000 deaths each year due to occupational respiratory diseases, about two-thirds of which were due to asbestos-related diseases or COPD.

## Lung diseases caused by workplace exposures  

##

- Asthma (about 15% of total)
- COPD (about 15% of total)
- Bronchiolitis obliterans
- Organising pneumonia 
- ILD (HP, pneumoconiosis, berrylliosis, hard metal disease)
- Lung cancer (IARC keeps a list that includes diesel fume) and mesothelioma 

## Lung diseases made worse by workplace exposures

##

- Asthma
- COPD
- ILD
- Cancer

## Attribution

## Outbreaks 

##
- Ardystil syndrome
- Humidifier disinfectant-associated interstitial lung disease 
- Metal fluid workers lung disease

#  Work-related asthma

## 'OA' is a 37 year old supermarket worker with breathlessness

##

- 'OA' Presented to A&E with a 2/7 history of increasing SOB
- Wheeze and non-productive cough. No chest pain / night sweats / fevers. Never smoker.
- No previous medical history, no regular medications. O/E tachypnoea, diffuse expiatory wheeze, PEFR 380 (70% predicted)
- CXR and bloods unremarkable

## A working diagnosis of asthma

##

- Oxygen, salbutamol and ipratropium bromide nebs
- Steroids
- Careful observation
- Better by day 3 and discharged with salbutamol inhaler and respiratory clinic f/u

## What's missing?

##

- An occupational history is missing
- What do you do and use in your job? (relevant exposures?)
- How long have you been there?
- Are your symptoms better when away from work?
- Are other people at work similarly unwell?

## Could it be occupational? 

## Yes it could be. Certainly sounds work related.

##

- OA has worked as at Tesco since she was 16. 6 years ago she
moved from working on the checkouts to working in the
bakery.
- OA makes the bread in a dusty enviornment with lots of
flour. For the past several months she has had nasal
congestion, cough, and wheeze.
- She feels better on the weekends and her symptoms almost
completely went away when she went to Ibiza on holiday for
2/52.

## Occupational asthma

- There are many asthmagens  
- There are many things to be done 
- There are many reasons to refer to a specialist


## Work exacerbated asthma

- The prognosis is different
- The managment is different
- There are many reasons to refer to a specialist

# Occupational asthma

##
- Sensitizer-induced 
- Irritant-induced e.g Reactive Airways Dysfunction Syndrome (RADS)

## A consensus definition

##

> Form of work-related asthma characterized by variable airflow obstruction, airway hyper responsiveness, and airway inflammation attributable to a particular exposure in the workplace and not due to stimuli encountered outside the workplace

Tarlo  et al. Diagnosis and management of work-related asthma: American College Of Chest Physicians Consensus Statement Chest. 2008;134(3 Suppl):1S.2.

## Sensitizers

##

- HMW agents (>5-10kD) act as sensitizing antigens e.g
animal and plant proteins and polysaccharides such as flour,
proteins in animal urine, and enzymes

- LMW agents, are haptens (incomplete antigens) e.g
disocyanates (nb cyanate group is RN=C=O) used in
polythene and plastics production, spray painting, foam coat
manufacture, and adhesive/sealant production use wood dusts
e.g western red cedar, persulfate salts e.g K2S2O8 used in
hair dye

## Why refer? 

##

- accurate diagnosis is important
- specialist tests, expertise, familiarity 
- management (and prognosis) differs depending on diagnosis


## What happens in the clinic

##

- full occupational history
- skin prick testing, spirometry, peak flow diary
- site visits
- bronchoprovocation testing
- discussion of what to do next
